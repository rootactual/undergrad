            This audio is ripped from a video assignement I had from Russian 102 discussing my typical day. The music track is Music: Soviet March by Shane Ivers - <a href="https://www.silvermansound.com" target="_blank">https://www.silvermansound.com</a>.
            To detach the audio from the video file, Final Cut Pro was utilized.  The second audio track, Soviet March, was added within Final Cut Pro.  Voice track boosted +12dB, music track dampened -12dB and faded at .75 seconds to end.
            From there the audio was sampled and exported as mp3 @ 44.1 kHz. That file was then processed through Human Media's Audio Converter at 8 kHz.
