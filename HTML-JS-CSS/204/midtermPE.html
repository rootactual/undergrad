        Before cleaning my skateboard wheels and bearings, I wondered how the pseudo-sinewave design of the 
        wheels would look as a GIF.  I shot a 15 second video with my Android phone, then utilized Giphy to 
        compress and convert the video to GIF format.  The filter added is a bit of slight-of-hand in an
        attempt to hide the loop and give it a "retro" feel.  The loop can still be noticed, but could be
        masked further with use of some form of hardware stabilization.
