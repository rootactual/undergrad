    <h1>JS Canvas</h1>

    <p>A sample of Javascript producing a 1000px wide by 600px tall canvas.  100 circles with randomized colors and radii up to 50px.</p>
    <canvas></canvas>
    <p> To pick a random color, I first had to decide how random is defined.  My thought process was to create an array of pseudo-random hex colors,<br/>
    then use <b>.floor()</b> and <b>.random()</b> against the <b>.length</b> of the hex array then use the stored variable for the stroke Style.  This felt to bulky and<br/>
    not truly random.  The next option I attempted was creating a function to generate a number for R, G, and B.  This was much less bulky, but felt<br/>
    as though it lacked efficiency.  Deeper research found the bithack method for hex (16777215 == ffffff).  As this is a one liner and taught me far more about JS<br/>
    I much preferred this idea.  The final decision was to utilize the bithack, combined with leftward bitshift.  Credits for code snippets and knowledge can be found <br/>
    within the script, as well as code for the previously mentioned concepts not utilized in the final product.
